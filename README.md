# Financial App - Deposit Management System

This is a financial management app where users can post deposits, cash out their balances, and generate reports with interest calculations. The app integrates a context API to manage user authentication, transaction data, and reports.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Register, login, and reset passwords.
- **Deposit Management**: Users can post deposits at different intervals (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly).
- **Cashout Mechanism**: Users can cash out from their deposited balance.
- **Interest Calculation**: The app calculates interest of 7% per year on deposits, with the calculation varying based on the deposit interval.
- **Reports**: Generate reports that include total balance, interest, and remaining balance per commitment.UI

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js, Material UI
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Token)
- **State Management**: Context API
- **API Communication**: Axios for HTTP requests

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dagmaros27/financial-app.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   **Frontend**:
   Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

   **Backend**:
   Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**
   In the backend directory, create a `.env` file with the following variables:

   ```makefile
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/financial-app
   JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
   PORT=5000
   SMTP_USER = your email provider
   SMTP_PASS = your email provider password
   ```

   For production, you can replace `localhost` with your MongoDB Atlas URI.

4. **Start the Development Servers**

   **Frontend**:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

   **Backend**:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

   The backend server will run on `http://localhost:5000`, and the frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Usage

### Authentication

- **Register**: Users can create an account by providing a username, email, and password.
- **Login**: Users can log in with their email and password.
- **Reset Password**: Users can reset their password via email if they forget it.

### Deposits

- **Add Deposit**: Users can add deposits by specifying the amount and the interval (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly). The deposit is saved, and the system will calculate the interest at a rate of 7% per year, depending on the interval.
- **Cashout**: Users can withdraw money from their deposits at any time. The cashout is processed based on their balance and the deposited amounts.

### Reports

- **Generate Reports**: Users can view reports that summarize their deposits, the interest earned, and the remaining balance per commitment. Reports are automatically updated as new deposits are made.

## Endpoints

### User Endpoints

- `POST /api/user/`: Register a new user
- `POST /api/user/login`: Login and get a JWT token
- `POST /api/user/forgot-password`: Send a password reset email
- `POST /api/user/reset-password`: Reset the password

### Transaction Endpoints

- `POST /api/transaction/deposit`: Post a new deposit
  - Body: `{ "amount": number, "interval": string }`
- `POST /api/transaction/cashout`: Request a cashout
  - Body: `{ "amount": number }`
- `GET /api/transaction/reports`: Get reports of deposits and interest

## State Management (Context API)

The `AppContext` is used to manage global state, including:

- **User state**: Stores user data and authentication status.
- **Transaction state**: Stores the list of deposits and cashouts.
- **Report state**: Stores the generated reports.

### How to Use Context API in Components

- Wrap your application with `AppProvider` to provide global state.
- Access context values with `useContext(AppContext)` in any component.

## Folder Structure

```bash
/frontend
  /public
  /src
    /components
    /context
    /pages
    /services
    /themes
    /utils
    /App.js
    /index.js
/backend
  /models
    /User.js
    /Transaction.js
  /controllers
    /userController.js
    /transactionController.js
   /middleware
    /auth.js
    /error.js
  /routes
    /userRoutes.js
    /transactionRoutes.js
   /utils
      /db.js
      /generateToken.js
      /sendOtp.js
  /app.js
  /server.js
```

### Frontend

- **components/**: Contains reusable UI components like `NavBar`.
- **context/**: Contains the `AppContext` and provider for state management.
- **pages/**: Contains different pages like `Dashboard`, `Reports`, etc.
- **App.js**: Main entry file for setting up routes and context provider.

### Backend

- **models/**: Defines Mongoose models for `User` and `Transaction`.
- **controllers/**: Contains the logic for user registration, login, deposit posting, and report generation.
- **middleware/**: Contains middleware functions for authentication and error handling.
- **routes/**: Defines the routes for each endpoint.
- **utils/**: Contains utility functions like database connection and token generation.
- **app.js**: Sets up Express, middleware, and routes.
- **server.js**: Starts the Express server.

## Error Handling

All API requests handle errors and provide feedback to the user. For example, if a user tries to post a deposit with an invalid amount, an error message will be displayed.

## Conclusion

This application allows users to manage their financial deposits, cashouts, and generate reports with interest calculations. The use of Reactâ€™s Context API makes state management efficient and accessible across components, while Axios handles communication with the backend.
